## Description
Stash is a server-side API that improves on what Pocket set out to do.  By
entering a URL into a form, sends back information about the article that was
automatically parsed and organized by Instaparser.  Accessing our API requires
the use of a user account, which must be created and then verified for each
request by our API. CRUD functionality is available for both users and
resources.  Pairs with our Client application, which makes an AJAX call to this
API.
